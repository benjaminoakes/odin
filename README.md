Odin is an **ATN** (Augmented Transition Network) based parser for natural languages with basic part of speech tagging and word-sense disambiguation. Currently, the only supported language is English, but other languages can be added.

If interested, please become a watcher.

It's based on a project I made for a Computational Linguistics course at the University of Iowa (taught by now-retired [Professor Oden][oden], hence the name) back in 2007.  It's not the earliest "serious" Ruby code I've written, but it's pretty close.

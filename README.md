Odin

Odin is an **ATN** (Augmented Transition Network) based parser for natural languages with basic part of speech tagging and word-sense disambiguation. Currently, the only supported language is English, but other languages can be added.

If interested, please become a watcher.

It's based on a project I made for a Computational Linguistics course at the University of Iowa (taught by [Professor Oden][oden]).  I have the code written already, so if you don't see it here, just send me a message and I'll get it pushed.

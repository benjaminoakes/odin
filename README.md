Odin is an **ATN** (Augmented Transition Network) based parser for natural languages with basic part of speech tagging and word-sense disambiguation. Currently, the only supported language is English, but other languages can be added.

If interested, please become a watcher.

History
-------

This is based on a project I made for a Computational Linguistics course at the University of Iowa (taught by now-retired [Professor Oden][oden], hence the name) in 2007.

Resources
---------

The design of the `AugmentedTransitionNetwork` class was inspired by Paul Graham's implementation in Lisp.  For details on his implementation, please see the full text of his book [_On Lisp_][onlisp] (pages 309 - 320).
